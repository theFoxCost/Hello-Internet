My curiosity doesn’t stop there; I’m also deeply interested in <span class="impo">cybersecurity</span>, which has led me to explore <span class="impo">ethical hacking</span> and even build my own <span class="impo">malware</span> (including <span class="impo">trojans</span> and <span class="impo">ransomware</span>). This hands-on experience has sharpened my skills and provided invaluable insights into the world of security.</p>
